# Polymint.me is a dapp that mints on polygon and solana, using your web3 wallet. No keys or funds or mints are stored anywhere, but onchain in your wallets.

All credits to Bilal for putting together what 3 others couldn't do. A few of the errors along the way were mine to own.
Never the Less, here is the lowdown: 
Gas fees set at minimums for 1st yr. Gov Board to decide after.
Poly is 3, so 3 types to mint, with fractionalization/tokenization for RWA. 
1. You can mint "Articles", content you create in any shape or form, it gets written onchain. 2nd is sound, or music, and 3rd is video (both up to 1GB in size). (prolly should stay below 900MB)

Tokenizations happen after you mint the nft, then you can assign tokens to fractionalize if you want, or tokenize a RWA.
Once mint has occured, then you can tokenize, and when connected to dapp, your personal profile has all mints, and details.

Enjoy!

Again, special thanks to Bilal for help connecting all the dots for this.
