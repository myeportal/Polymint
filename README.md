# Polymint.me is a dapp that mints on polygon and solana, using your web3 wallet. We do not store keys or funds from those who interact with this dapp/site.
All credits to Bilal for putting together what 3 others couldn't do. A few of the errors along the way were mine to own.
Never the Less, here is the lowdown: 
Gas fees set at minimums for 1st yr. Gov Board to decide after
Poly is 3, so 3 types to mint, with fractionalization/tokenization for RWA. 
You can mint "Articles", content you create in any shape or form, it gets written onchain. Next is sound, or music, and video up to 1GB in size, (prolly should stay below 900MB)
Writes to IPFS, so all minting is verified through the tx and drilling down
Once mint has occured, then you can tokenize, and when connected to dapp, your personal profile has all mints, and details.
Enjoy!

Again, special thanks to Bilal.
